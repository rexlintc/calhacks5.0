## Introduction to Blockchain Technology and an analysis of TRON

## Inspiration
Blockchains are presently a widely-known nascent field of Computer Science due to the explosion of interest in Bitcoin and altcoins. While many people in the US and around the world dove into the Bitcoin craze and lost dearly during its crash, most people do not understand the details of Bitcoin and the blockchain technology that it utilizes. Rex and I have created this series to educate the public about the basics of blockchain technology in a concise manner. We hope that this information reaches many viewers and educates them about the essentials and dangers of this highly influential, new field.

## Challenges We Ran Into
The need to create content that is accessible to the gamut of blockchain learner from amateur to professional was a matter that we had to ponder thoroughly. To tackle this problem, we organized our work from simple to comprehensive. We started with a Prezi presentation giving a basic overview of the blockchain with a few examples followed by an article split into two parts: the first giving a high-level overview of TRON with the second analysing TRON's features and briefly comparing TRON to its competitors. This flow of information provides a gentle introduction for the uninitiated blockchain user to more complex topics for veterans.

## How We Built it
We used Prezi to create the presentation and Medium to host the articles.
